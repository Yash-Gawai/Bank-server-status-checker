# Bank-server-status-checker

Often, the bank servers are not available while trying to do transactions. Many times, it has happened that I've had food and when the time to pay comes, the server is down.
It would be beneficial if the apps inform the user if the server is unavailable before the attempt at payment is done.

A GUI to select the bank from a dropdown menu is made in ping_test.py using tkinter.

The GUI prints the output selected in the dropdown menu to the console and ping_test_2.py and uses it as an input to check for the server status and returns a response based on it.
